## A little bit about me...

I'm an experienced full-stack programmer passionate about building financial technology products for startups and enterprises. I like fruits, sunshine and bad jokes, I'm not a robot.

Besides my technical ability, I communicate with clarity, precision and pretty good at follow-ups. In retrospect, my first 10,000 lines of code looked quite embarrassing. I've since written over 400,000 lines of good, quality code in an agile and test-driven development environment.

I made a deliberate choice to make Golang my primary language back in 2012 when Go version 1 was released. I fell in love with the language because of its simplicity and readability. Currently, I write and maintain scalable cloud software in a modern, distributed, multi-programmer and open source world.

For the last 4 years, I have built Golang libraries and infrastructure, deployed and maintained projects running in production and also led teams of engineers and designers in product development right from ideation to delivery. Prior to that, I worked in diverse Research and Development environments for 7 years focusing primarily on Health, Water, Food Security and Livelihood projects.

## Experience at 10,000ft

In summary, my experience spans around;

1. DevOps Engineering - building reliable systems and continuous delivery pipelines using agile and lean principles.
2. Building cloud-native architectures in Go.
3. Building financial technology products in a startup environment leveraging on third party APIs from mobile wallets, banks and card processors.
4. R&D with both local and international development partners.
5. Technical leadership and product management.
6. Experience with modern DevOps tooling - infrastructure as code, configuration management, CI pipelines, package managers.

## Tinkerer Extraordinaire, really?

Well, I talk (too much) about containers and also a proud member of the house of bash, where when annoyed we replace things with tiny shell scripts.
